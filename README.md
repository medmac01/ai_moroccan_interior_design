# Moroccan AI Interior Design üá≤üá¶ü¶Å
Moroccan Interior design generator using diffusion and ControlNet.
This project was made during the ThinkAI Hackathon made by 1337AI & Math-Maroc.


## Introduction
Diffusion models are a type of generative model that use the process of diffusion to generate realistic samples from a given distribution. They operate by iteratively "diffusing" noise or random input through a sequence of learned transformations, which are typically implemented as neural networks. At each diffusion step, the noise is gradually transformed to create a more complex and detailed representation of the target distribution. By applying this process repeatedly, diffusion models can generate high-quality samples that capture the statistical properties of the underlying distribution. These models have shown promising results in a variety of domains, including image and text generation, and have the potential to be a powerful tool for data-driven applications.


## Use Case
Imagine you're a stylist who wants to get inspired by new interior designs, or even someone who likes to change his living room's look from time to time. This solution will give you an infinity of interior designs,
